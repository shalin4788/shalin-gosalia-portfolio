# AI Governance & Compliance Statement

## Overview
This repository hosts the portfolio and prototypes for **Pran.ai**. We prioritize **Trustworthy AI** as defined by the **EU AI Act** and global ethical standards.

## 1. Risk Classification
* **Classification:** Limited Risk / General Purpose AI.
* **Rationale:** The system provides life-path recommendations and planning. It does not perform "High-Risk" functions like automated recruitment, credit scoring, or biometric identification.

## 2. Compliance Measures
* **Transparency (Art. 50):** The UI explicitly discloses when users are interacting with AI agents (The Planner, Sentinel, etc.).
* **Human-in-the-Loop:** All AI recommendations require manual user confirmation or editing before being finalized in the life-path roadmap.
* **Data Privacy:** This prototype follows "Privacy by Design" principles. No sensitive category data (Art. 9) is processed.

## 3. Responsible AI Principles
* **Accountability:** AI agents are used as co-pilots, not autonomous decision-makers.
* **Accuracy:** Recommendations are grounded in provided Knowledge Bases to minimize hallucinations.
