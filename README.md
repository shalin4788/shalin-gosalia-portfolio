## 🎯 The Mission
This portfolio serves as a "Product Proof of Concept" for my leadership style: **Governance-by-design, measurable scale, and technical depth.** It highlights my experience shipping GenAI, RAG, and NLU systems within complex regulatory frameworks (Morgan Stanley, E*TRADE).

## 📊 Performance & Scale (The "Why")
* **Advisors Supported:** 25K+ internal users via AI-augmented workflows.
* **Client Impact:** 2M+ clients served across digital servicing platforms.
* **Economic Value:** ~$15M annual savings opportunity identified/delivered.
* **Quality:** +15% NPS lift at the program level through AI modernization.

## 🛠 What I Build (The "How")
* **GenAI / RAG Systems:** Ground truth orchestration, semantic search, and citation-led retrieval.
* **AI Orchestration Layers:** Routing, policy controls, and human-in-the-loop (HITL) review frameworks.
* **Governance Frameworks:** Model-risk monitoring and compliance-aligned AI delivery.
* **Evaluation Suites:** Runtime KPI instrumentation and model error taxonomies.

## 🏗 Technical Stack & Architecture
This portfolio is built with a "minimalist-tech" philosophy to ensure maximum performance and high-end executive aesthetics.

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Modern Grid/Flexbox), Glassmorphism UI.
- **Design System:** "Executive Slate" theme—focusing on dark-mode high contrast and data scannability.
- **CI/CD:** Automated deployment via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages.
- **Version Control:** Managed via Git (using a feature-branch/fix-version workflow).
